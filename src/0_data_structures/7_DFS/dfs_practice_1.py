"""
Implement a DEPTH FIRST SEARCH (DFS) suing a stack. For simplicity, we always use a deque to implement this.
DFS uses a stack in its implementation.

Example graph represented as an adjacency list.
    graph: Dict[int, List[int]] = {
        0: [1, 2],
        1: [0, 3, 4],
        2: [0, 5],
        3: [1],
        4: [1, 5],
        5: [2, 4]
    }
